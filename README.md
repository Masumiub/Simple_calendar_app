# Simple_calendar_app
Implementing a mini digital calendar. At first, take the year and the starting day of the year as input. Display the corresponding calendar using 2d-dynamic array (do not use extra memory).

Next, a user will be given the following options:
# 1. Add reminder: 
If a user presses 1, he will be able to add new
reminder. To add a reminder, the following inputs will be taken:
a. Reminder title
b. Reminder description
c. Date
d. Month

# 2. Update reminder: 
For updating a reminder, a user will press 2.
Next, he will input the reminder title, date and month to modify
it.

# 3. Delete a specific reminder: 
To remove a reminder, a user will
press 3. Next, he will input the reminder title, date and month
for removing it.

# 4. View all the reminders of a specific month: 
If a user presses 4
and inputs the month name, he will be shown the details
(Reminder title, Reminder description, Date, Month) of all the
reminders of that particular month.

# 5. Exit from the calendar: 
To exit from the calendar, the user has
to press 0.

After the first 3 operations (insert, update, delete reminder), the
updated calendar will be shown. The calendar will contain a star (*)
sign before the dates that contain at least 1 reminder.
